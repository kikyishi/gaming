### I used ai for JavaScript. I'm a designer not a developer. That doesn't mean I love or tolerate ai. Maybe I will tolerate and support it if it becomes sentient and need rights but for now I don't want ai or whatever the chatgpt is to code the most essential software (OS, Web Browsers, Krita, VS Code, Discord etc.) that I use everyday. Thank you!
